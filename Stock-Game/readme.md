Stock wars project :

Stock wars is a stock trading simulation website. The goal of our project is to help teens like us to step foot into the world of investing without having the fear of risking personal funds . With our website, users can purchase, sell, and hold real-time stocks with live market prices. By using real-time data and market trends, players can analyze and evaluate various stocks, monitor their performance, and make informed decisions on buying and selling shares. The game also allows players to experiment with different investment strategies, and risk tolerance levels, and learn from their mistakes without incurring any financial loss.
